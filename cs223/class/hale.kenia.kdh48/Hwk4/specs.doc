8.4 Assignment 4, due Thursday 2018-03-01, at 11:00pm
For this assignment, you are to implement a data type representing a deck of playing cards.

8.4.1 Your task
The file deck.h, also shown in the Interface section below, defines the interface to the data type. Your job is to provide a matching deck.c file.

A deck consists of an ordered sequence of 0 or more cards, implemented as the struct card type. Each card has a rank, which is a character in the string "A23456789TJQK", and a suit, which is a character in the string "CDHS". A card is printed by giving the rank and then the suit. For example, the Ten of Diamonds has rank 'T' and suit 'D', and would be printed as TD.

A deck is printed by printing all the cards in the deck, separated by spaces. The deckPrint function should do this. There should not be a space after the last card.

The deckCreate and deckDestroy functions create and destroy decks. A new deck always contains 52 cards, ordered by suit, then rank.

The deckGetCard function removes and returns the card at the top of a deck. The deckPutCard function adds a new card to the bottom of a deck.

Two additional functions split and combine decks. The deckSplit function takes a deck d, and a number n, and returns (using pointers passed in by the caller) two decks d1 and d2, where d1 contains the top n cards in d (or all cards in d if n is greater than or equal to the size of d), and d2 contains any cards that are left over. As a side effect, deckSplit destroys d. The deckShuffle function combines two decks d1 and d2 by alternately taking cards from the top of each deck, starting with d1; if one of the decks runs out, the remaining deck supplies the rest of the cards. Like  deckShuffle, deckSplit returns a new deck and destroys its inputs.

A test harness that you can use to try out your code can be found in testDeck.c. This implements Deck Assembly Language, a minimalist programming language for manipulating decks. Here is an example of running testDeck by hand. Note that inputs and outputs are interleaved.

#include <stdio.h>

// Standard suits and ranks
#define SUITS "CDHS"
#define RANKS "A23456789TJQK"

// Remove and return the top card of a deck.

void deckPutCard(Deck *d, Card c);

// Split a deck into two piles:

//    *d2 is new deck with remaining cards in d.
// Order of cards is preserved.

void deckSplit(Deck *d, int n, Deck **d1, Deck **d2);

// Shuffle two decks together by alternating cards from

// Running time should be O(length of shorter deck).
// Destroys d1 and d2.
//
// If d1 == d2, behavior of this function is undefined.
Deck *deckShuffle(Deck *d1, Deck *d2);

// Print the contents of deck to f as sequence of ranks/suits
// separated by spaces.
// Example output: "AS TC 9D 3H 5S" (without quotes)
// Running time should be O(length of deck).
